-------------

### What is Red Queen?
Red Queen is a discord bot developed using a combination of *node.js* and *discord.js*.

### Why the name?
The name is a reference to the [Red Queen Artificial Intelligence](https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Queen_(Anderson)) from the live-action [Resident Evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_(film_series)) films. A supercomputer that controls the secret underground Umbrella Corporation lab (and is a bit on the sinister side).

### What does this bot require to run?
The bot runs on node.js and requires the modules *youtube-search*, *google-images* and *discord.js* in order to function. *FFMPEG* is used to decode and play the audio stream.

### Required Changes
Make sure to edit the *config.json* with the appropriate discord user id and  API keys for the music and image functionality to operate correctly.

### Updates
#### Update (Jan 2020)
